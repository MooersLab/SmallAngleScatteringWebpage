# Biological Small Angle Scattering Webpage

This is a massive rewrite of the popular OU Medicine Small Angle Scattering webpage that no longer became available as of late October 2020.
The update is still in progress.
The rise of SEC-SAXS in the past five years has changed the field.
I have much to add about SEC-SAXS.
The current information is still useful for self-study.
